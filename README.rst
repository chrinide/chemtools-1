ChemTools: Python tools for Computational Chemistry
===================================================

Chemtools is a set of modules that is intended to help with more
advanced computations using common electronic structure methods/
programs. Currently the is some limited support for Gamess-US_ and
MolPro_ program packages but other codes can be easily interfaced.
